Description: Code coverage analysis using DWARF debugging information
 Kcov is a code coverage tester based on bcov by Thomas Neumann. It allows
 collecting code coverage information from executables without special
 command-line arguments, and continuosly produces output from long-running
 applications. 
 .
 Kcov, like Bcov, uses DWARF debugging information to make this possible.
